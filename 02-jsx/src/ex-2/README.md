## Game of life

Implement a React component that renders an 2x2 game of life. Cells should alternate between dead and alive. The markup below shows a potential structure (without styling) - other approaches (e.g. using table) are ok too.

````html
<div><!-- root -->
  <div><!-- grid containing 4 cells -->
    <div />
    <div />
    <div />
    <div />
  </div>
  <button>Tick</button><!-- tick button -->
</div>
````

For brownie points, try and make it 8x8.
