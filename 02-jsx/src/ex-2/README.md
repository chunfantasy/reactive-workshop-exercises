## Exercise

Implement a React component that renders an 2x2 [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Cells should alternate between dead and alive. The markup below shows a potential structure (without styling) - other approaches (e.g. using table) are ok too.

```html
<div>
  <div>
    <!-- grid containing 4 cells -->
    <div />
    <div />
    <div />
    <div />
  </div>
  <button>Tick</button>
</div>
```

For brownie points, try and make it 8x8.
