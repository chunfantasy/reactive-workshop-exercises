## Exercise

Implement a React component that renders a game of life. Cells should alternate between dead and alive. Dimensions (n) and cell size (width and height) should be passed through props.
Default values should be n = 10, width = 20, height = 20.

```javascript
<GameOfLife n={2} width={50} height={50} />
<GameOfLife />
```
